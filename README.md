📌 Problem Statement

Predict product prices accurately using multimodal data (text + images) for Amazon-like product listings.
The evaluation metric is SMAPE, emphasizing robustness across low-, medium-, and high-priced products.


🚀 Executive Summary

We propose a multimodal deep learning solution that fuses textual, visual, and engineered features to predict product prices.
Our final system uses:
1. TF-IDF + SVD for structured text understanding
2. ResNet50 image embeddings + PCA for visual signals
3. A 5-layer feed-forward neural network
4. A custom SMAPE-optimized hybrid loss function

🏆 Final Result

1. Cross-Validation SMAPE: 48.40
2. Relative improvement: ~11% over baseline
3. Low fold variance: ±0.30 → stable generalization

🧩 Methodology Overview
🔍 Key Data Observations

1. Price range: $0.13 – $2,796 → log transformation required
2. ~38% products priced below $10 → needs weighted learning
3. Pack size & quantity strongly affect price
4. Premium keywords (organic, imported, artisan) matter
5. Category-based price tiers exist (wine, cheese vs water, powder)

⚠️ Challenges Faced
1. ❌ Transformer models rejected (API dependency)
2. ❌ Regex-only extraction failed on inconsistent formats
3. ⚠️ Image CDN throttling
4. ⚠️ Category imbalance & rare expensive items

✅ Solutions
1. TF-IDF + SVD over transformers
2. Manual rule-based extraction
3. PCA + batch processing
4. Bayesian smoothing & heavy regularization

🔮 Future Improvements

1. Attention-based feature weighting
2. Price-bucketed models
3. Category-specific experts
4. Vision Transformers (ViT)
5. Multi-task learning (price + category)
6. Graph-based brand/category modeling

🏁 Conclusion
This project demonstrates that careful feature engineering + metric-aware optimization can outperform heavier models.
Our multimodal DNN achieves stable, competitive performance while remaining fully offline, reproducible, and efficient.
